## Abstract

This study proposes that the mass hierarchy of elementary particles is governed by a geometric principle of two-dimensional quantization. We show that a single, theoretically-derived parameter, $\gamma \approx 20.2$, organizes the masses of leptons, heavy bosons, and hadrons on a quadratic lattice $m/m_e = n_1^2 + \gamma n_2^2$ with high precision and no fine-tuning. The theoretical value of $\gamma$ is derived from a vacuum energy minimization model, where a spontaneous symmetry breaking locks the vacuum's vibrational modes into a narrow angular wedge. Statistical validation against a null hypothesis confirms the significance of the fit ($p \approx 0.012$), and the uniqueness of the integer-pair assignments is ensured by a robust stability margin. The model reduces the observed mass spectrum to a simple rule of geometric quantization.
